Types of Surveillance in Bank


1.	Trade Surveillance

Monitors financial markets and trading activities to detect insider trading, market abuse, and other violations.

Example: A trader at a bank places multiple large buy orders to create artificial demand but cancels them before execution (spoofing). The system flags this suspicious activity, triggering an investigation.


2.	Communication Surveillance

Monitors emails, phone calls, chat messages, and other communications to detect misconduct and ensure compliance.

Example: A compliance team detects an employee using WhatsApp to discuss non-public company earnings with an external party, violating insider trading regulations.


3.	Financial Crime Surveillance

Focuses on preventing money laundering, fraud, and terrorist financing.

Example: A customer deposits small amounts of cash across multiple bank branches, avoiding detection limits (structuring/smurfing). The bank's AML system flags this as suspicious activity.


4.	Transaction Surveillance

Monitors financial transactions to detect anomalies and potential rule violations.

Example: A high-net-worth individual suddenly transfers large sums to offshore accounts, triggering a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) under AML regulations.


5.	 Cybersecurity Surveillance

Protects financial systems from cyber threats, hacking, and data breaches.

Example: A bank's intrusion detection system (IDS) detects multiple failed login attempts from an unusual IP address, indicating a possible brute-force attack, and blocks access.


6.	Payment and Card Transaction Surveillance

Detects fraudulent activities in banking transactions and card payments.

Example: A customer’s debit card is suddenly used in three different countries within an hour. The system flags it as potential fraud and blocks the card.



Surveillance in the trade life cycle is a multi-layered process that involves monitoring activities before, during, and after trades are executed. It leverages advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, and big data analytics to detect and prevent market abuse, ensure compliance, and maintain market integrity. Each type of surveillance plays a critical role in safeguarding the financial markets and protecting investors.



Types of Surveillance in the Trade life cycle.


1. Pre-Trade Surveillance

Purpose: Monitors activities before a trade is executed to prevent market manipulation, insider trading, or other regulatory breaches.

Key Activities:

•	Monitoring order flow for unusual patterns (e.g., spoofing, layering).

•	Checking for insider trading by analyzing pre-trade communications and market data.

•	Ensuring compliance with pre-trade risk limits and regulatory requirements.

Tools: Real-time monitoring systems, algorithms, and pattern recognition software.

 

2. Trade Execution Surveillance

Purpose: Ensures that trades are executed fairly and in compliance with regulations.

Key Activities:

•	Monitoring for best execution practices.

•	Detecting manipulative trading practices like front-running or wash trading.

•	Ensuring adherence to exchange rules and market protocols.

Tools: Trade execution monitoring systems, audit trails, and transaction reporting tools.

 

3. Post-Trade Surveillance

Purpose: Analyzes completed trades to identify suspicious activities or compliance breaches.

Key Activities:

•	Reviewing trade data for anomalies (e.g., large trades, off-market prices).

•	Detecting late reporting or failure to report trades.

•	Identifying potential market abuse, such as marking the close or painting the tape.

Tools: Trade reconciliation systems, post-trade analytics, and regulatory reporting platforms.

 

4. Market Surveillance

Purpose: Monitors overall market activity to detect manipulation, fraud, or systemic risks.

Key Activities:

•	Analyzing market-wide data for unusual trends or volatility.

•	Detecting cross-market manipulation or coordinated trading.

•	Monitoring for breaches of market-wide circuit breakers or trading halts.

Tools: Market-wide surveillance systems, big data analytics, and AI-based pattern detection.

 

5. Communications Surveillance

Purpose: Monitors communications (e.g., emails, chats, phone calls) to detect insider trading, market manipulation, or other misconduct.

Key Activities:

•	Scanning for keywords or phrases indicating potential misconduct.

•	Analyzing communication patterns between traders, brokers, and clients.

•	Ensuring compliance with record-keeping requirements.

Tools: Natural language processing (NLP), voice recognition, and communication monitoring platforms.

 

6. Behavioral Surveillance

Purpose: Tracks the behavior of traders and other market participants to identify potential risks or misconduct.

Key Activities:

•	Monitoring trading patterns for deviations from normal behavior.

•	Identifying excessive risk-taking or unauthorized trading.

•	Detecting collusion or coordinated activities among traders.

Tools: Behavioral analytics, machine learning, and anomaly detection systems.

 

7. Regulatory Reporting Surveillance

Purpose: Ensures accurate and timely reporting of trades to regulators.

Key Activities:

•	Monitoring for discrepancies in trade reporting.

•	Detecting failures to report trades or incorrect reporting.

•	Ensuring compliance with regulations like MiFID II, EMIR, or Dodd-Frank.

Tools: Regulatory reporting platforms, reconciliation tools, and audit systems.

 

8. Risk-Based Surveillance

Purpose: Focuses on high-risk areas or entities to allocate surveillance resources effectively.

Key Activities:

•	Identifying high-risk traders, instruments, or markets.

•	Prioritizing surveillance efforts based on risk assessments.

•	Monitoring for breaches of risk limits or thresholds.

Tools: Risk management systems, predictive analytics, and risk scoring models.

9. Cross-Market Surveillance

Purpose: Monitors activities across multiple markets or asset classes to detect cross-market manipulation or arbitrage.

Key Activities:

•	Analyzing correlations between different markets.

•	Detecting cross-market insider trading or coordinated trading.

•	Monitoring for regulatory arbitrage.

Tools: Cross-market surveillance platforms, big data analytics, and AI-based tools.



10. Client Activity Surveillance

Purpose: Monitors client trading activities to ensure compliance and detect potential misconduct.

Key Activities:

•	Identifying suspicious client trading patterns.

•	Monitoring for front-running or preferential treatment of clients.

•	Ensuring adherence to client suitability and appropriateness rules.

Tools: Client activity monitoring systems, CRM tools, and compliance platforms
